1. Compiling.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
toowoobaa - Kox's 2 dimentional snow-flake constructor
PNG lib is requared for kox[23]png.c to make output png's.

First of all You need to configure the program:
$ ./configure
(This script is produced by GNU autoconf from configure.in and requares m4)

If there was no errors during configure, it would create Makefile and config.h
Just do
$ make
to compile programs.

2. Using.
~~~~~~~~~

toowoobaa -- programs to construct 2 and 3 dimentional snowflakes.
toowoobaa png -- programs to transform output of kox[23]d into PNG files.
(rotate helps to produce a script for making `rotaing' views of 3d snowflake)

`toowoobaa' and `toowoobaa png' print a help message if started with `--help'
argument.

`toowoobaa d' print its output (by default) to stdout and progress info to stderr.

Example:
$ ./toowoobaa -l 6 -e 300 -v | ./toowoobaa png -s 200 -a 4 -o 1.png
would produce file `1.png' with 3 dimentional snowflake of 6ths level (option
`-l 6') having it's biggest edge of 300 "points" legth (option `-e 300'),
picture size would be 400x400 (option -s 200), antialiasing depth 4 (it's
maximum, option `-a 4'); point of view , direction of light, color of
snowflake and color of light are leaved to there default values.
As for me (PIII 866, 1G) this took about 1 minute.
